# Notes

- Javascript is a `high-level`, `object-oriented`, `multi-paradigm` programming language.
  - multi-paradigm language, meaning that it's so flexible and versatile, that we can use all kinds of different programming styles, such as imperative and declarative programming (different ways of structuring our code)
